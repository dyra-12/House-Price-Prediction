<h1>House Price Prediction</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>House Price Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of houses based on various features such as size, 
  location, number of bedrooms, etc. This project utilizes Python programming language and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn 
  to build a predictive model. The model learns patterns from historical data and then uses those patterns to make predictions on new, unseen data.</p>

  <h3>Features:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Data Collection: The project involves collecting a dataset containing information about houses, including features like size, number of bedrooms, location, amenities, etc. This dataset serves as the basis for training the predictive model.</li>
    <li>Data Preprocessing: Before training the model, the dataset needs to be preprocessed. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.</li>
    <li>Model Training: The heart of the project is training a machine learning model on the prepared dataset. Various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting can be used for this task. The model learns the relationship between the input features and the target variable (house prices).</li>
    <li>Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it needs to be evaluated to assess its performance. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are commonly used to evaluate regression models.</li>
    <li>Prediction: After evaluating the model, it can be used to make predictions on new data. Users can input the features of a house, and the model will output the predicted price based on those features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Python: As the primary programming language for implementing the project logic, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.</li>
    <li>Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset.</li>
    <li>scikit-learn: A powerful machine learning library in Python that provides various algorithms for regression, as well as utilities for model evaluation and preprocessing.</li>
    <li>Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization tasks, including creating plots, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to gain insights into the data and model performance.</li>
    <li>Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts: The project can be developed using Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and experimentation, or as Python scripts for reproducibility and deployment in production environments.</li>
  </ul>
